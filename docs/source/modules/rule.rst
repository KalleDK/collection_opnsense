Limitations
***********

This plugin has some limitations you need to know of:

* ports don't support aliases
* each of these parameters only takes ONE value per rule:

  * port
  * protocol (*or 'any'; 'TCP/UDP' is NOT valid*)
  * ip-protocol (*IPv4/IPv6*)
  * direction

* gateway-groups are not valid yet => see `OPNSense Forum <https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=30077.msg146268#msg146268>`_ or `OPNSense Issue <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/issues/3139>`_
* the ruleset managed by this plugin is SEPARATE from the default WEB-UI rules (*Firewall - Rules*) - combined usage might bring complications
* interfaces must be provided as used in the network config (*p.e. 'opt1' instead of 'DMZ'*)

  * per example see menu: 'Interface - Assignments - Interface ID (in brackets)'
  * this brings problems if the interface-names are not the same on both nodes when using HA-setups

Info
****

Savepoint
=========

You can prevent lockout-situations using the savepoint systems:

- :ref:`ansibleguy.opnsense.savepoint <modules_savepoint>`

Mass-Manage
===========

If you want to mass-manage rules - take a look at the :ref:`ansibleguy.opnsense.rule_multi <modules_rule_multi>` module. It scales better for that use-case!

Web-UI
======

These rules are shown in the separate WEB-UI table.

Usage
*****

First you will have to know about **rule-matching**.

The module somehow needs to link the configured and existing rules to manage them.

You need to set how this matching is done by setting the 'match_fields' parameter!

It is **recommended** to use/set **unique identifiers** like 'description' to make sure rules can be matched without overlapping.

You could also use the UUID of existing rules as ID - but you would have to pull (*list*) and configure those 'manually'.

Purging
=======

If you want to delete all existing rules that are **NOT CONFIGURED**.

You can also use the :ref:`ansibleguy.opnsense.rule_purge <modules_rule_multi>` module to do this in a cleaner way.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - hosts: localhost
      gather_facts: no
      module_defaults:
        group/ansibleguy.opnsense.all:
          firewall: 'opnsense.template.ansibleguy.net'
          api_credential_file: '/home/guy/.secret/opn.key'

        ansibleguy.opnsense.list:
          target: 'rule'

        ansibleguy.opnsense.rule:
          match_fields: ['description']

      vars:
        rules: {...}

      tasks:
        - name: Pulling existing rules
          ansibleguy.opnsense.list:
          #  target: 'rule'
          register: existing_entries

        - name: Purging unconfigured rules
          ansibleguy.opnsense.rule:
            state: 'absent'
            description: "{{ existing_rule_id }}"

          when: existing_rule_id not in rules

          vars:
            existing_rule_id: "{{ existing_rule_item.value.description }}"

          loop_control:
            loop_var: existing_rule_item
          with_dict: "{{ existing_entries.data }}"
