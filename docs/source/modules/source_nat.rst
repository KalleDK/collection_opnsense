Source NAT

**STATE**: unstable

**TESTS**: `Playbook <https://github.com/ansibleguy/collection_opnsense/blob/latest/tests/source_nat.yml>`_

**API Docs**: `Core - Firewall <https://docs.opnsense.org/development/api/core/firewall.html>`_

**Service Docs**: `Outbound NAT <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/nat.html#outbound>`_

Limitations
***********

This plugin has some limitations you need to know of:

* ports don't support aliases
* each of these parameters only takes ONE value per rule:

  * port
  * protocol (*or 'any'; 'TCP/UDP' is NOT valid*)
  * ip-protocol (*IPv4/IPv6*)

* the ruleset managed by this plugin is SEPARATE from the default WEB-UI rules (*Firewall - NAT - Outbound*) - combined usage might bring complications
* interfaces must be provided as used in the network config (*p.e. 'opt1' instead of 'DMZ'*)

  * per example see menu: 'Interface - Assignments - Interface ID (in brackets)'
  * this brings problems if the interface-names are not the same on both nodes when using HA-setups


Info
****

Savepoint
=========

You can prevent lockout-situations using the savepoint systems:

- :ref:`ansibleguy.opnsense.savepoint <modules_savepoint>`

Web-UI
======

These rules are shown in the separate WEB-UI table.

Usage
*****

First you will have to know about **rule-matching**.

The module somehow needs to link the configured and existing rules to manage them.

You need to set how this matching is done by setting the 'match_fields' parameter!

It is **recommended** to use/set **unique identifiers** like 'description' to make sure rules can be matched without overlapping.

You could also use the UUID of existing rules as ID - but you would have to pull (*list*) and configure those 'manually'.
